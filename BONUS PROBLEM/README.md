
#Introduction
This project will handle three different algorithms for text processing, specifically patten recognition.
A problem arises when processing a large text file, performance can be significantly enhanced by using algorithms other then the naive approach.
We will explore the Brute Force algorithm, Boyer Moore algorithm and KMP algorithms.


#Description
Brute Force algorithm:


Boyer Moore algorithm:


KMP algorithm:


#Description of text documents
The text documents used are:
* Vibrio_cholerae.txt, It contains the genome of Vibrio cholerae, a bactirium resposible for the cholera disease
* ori.txt, It contains the location of the origin of replication

All three algorithms will process the text files to find the pattern (origin of replication) inside the genome of the bacteria
